/**
 * Using any of the tools you've worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

    Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice.
    When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
    A heading should say whether it is X's or O's turn and change with each move made.
    A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
    When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap alert or similar Bootstrap component should appear 
    across the screen announcing the winner.

    I need:
    A tic-tac-toe game board (3 x #)
    X or O on click
    Button to clear the board & play again
    A Bootstrap alert declaring the winner at the end of the game 

    Rules:
    3 x 3 grid
    you want 3 in a row to win
    2 players take turns
